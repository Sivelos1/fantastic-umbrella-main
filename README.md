  # Description

  Say you had an online store, and wanted to create a database that could sort through all of the wonderful products you have to offer. Its so much work doing it yourself, so this serves as a plug-and-play back end service for all of your E-commerce needs!

  ## Installation

  To install the project, download the repository. Navigate to where you installed the project in your command line, and use the command npm install to install the projects dependencies.

  You may have to create a .env file. Do so, and place it at the root of this project. In the .env file, create the follow variables:
